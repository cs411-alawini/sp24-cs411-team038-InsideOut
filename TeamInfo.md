| Title       | CourseCompass            |

## Project Summary
CourseCompass attempts to combine three beloved applications used by students on UIUC campus: GPA Disparity, Rate My Professor, and Course Explorer. Instead of having to navigate through all three sites to cross-examine the GPA distribution for a certain professor in a certain course across sections, CourseCompass allows students to receive all that information from one place. CourseCompass will provide a user-friendly interface through which students can search up specific courses, subjects, professors and course sections to examine the distribution of grades, ratings of professors from other students, and information about courses and offered sections to make well-informed decisions about their schedule. Using this information, they will also be able to make a tentative course schedule, on our application itself.
